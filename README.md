# UltraTTS
Simple yet Powerfull Sapi 4/5 TTS Reader


If you are into TTS you surly know BalaBolka, it is a advanced TTS tool to create audio-books, using SAPI Voices. It can also read text from clipboard as well as install a global hot key to issue a Ctrl+C and than read whatever ended up in the clipboard. While it excels in its job as a audio-book maker, it is lacking features as a TTS Reader. Unfortunately the tool, while being free, is not open source so improving on its TTS Reader qualities is not possible. But what is possible is to create an own Open Source GPLv3 tool which would excel in just being a TTS Reader, and looking familiar.

Hence UltraTTS the tool provides a set of features helpful for people using TTS a lot. 

1.) Ultra TTS can auto detect the language of the text and if a corresponding voice is installed it will be used, so no more having to open the UI and switch the language whenever you read something different. The auto detect functionality even works within text blocks. for example when quoting a english sentence in a german publication. 

2.) Ultra TTS by default queues texts such that you can clich for example through a multi page article and than lean back or do whatever productive you want to do in the mean time and listen to all of it on one go.

3.) Ultra TTS can use Cortana Voices if installed.

4.) The text read out is always copied to the tab such that if you want you can re read it even if you already changed your clipboard content and closed the page the text was on.

5.) All important things can be done with global hot keys.

6.) After successfully grabbed a text from clipboard the original clipboard content is restored.
